# Please save the S_DECOR_BG logo image as:
# /public/s-decor-bg-logo.png or /public/s-decor-bg-logo.jpg

# Since I cannot directly save the image from the screenshot, please:
# 1. Save the logo image you showed me to: C:\Nikola\ME\proj\Stefan-nextjs\public\s-decor-bg-logo.png
# 2. Make sure it's named exactly: s-decor-bg-logo.png

# Then I'll update the Hero component to use it.
